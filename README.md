# DocNosis

Using DocNosis, users can get access to local/worldwide medical professional opinions with a click of a buttonâ€”able to upload their questions/descriptions along with images. Doctors can then add a comment/diagnosis to those posts, and users can give a rating to those doctors at any time. With access to doctor/patient contact info, patients can then go through a formal process to reach out to local doctors and set a time for checkups.
